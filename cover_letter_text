Dear Hiring Manager,

I am very interested in the Software Engineer position at egnyte which I discovered through LinkenIn. 

I have just finished my Master's in Computer Science, and am looking for an awesome startup at which I can work hard and grow. I am well qualified for this position, as I have several years of development experience in C++, C#, and Python in both academia and industry. My projects include multi-threaded GUIs written in WPF, robotics control software, C++ simulation software with a Python interface, and some web stuff including HTML, JavaScript, and Python/Django for fun. Linux is my platform of choice. Please review my resume for details.

Please consider me for an interview - phone or Skype work well for me. You can contact me via email at gareth.ferneyhough@gmail.com, or by phone at 775-250-8441. Thank you for your consideration.

Best,
Gareth Ferneyhough
